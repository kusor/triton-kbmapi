# Key Backup and Management API (KBMAPI)

The goal of this is to provide an API that will be used to manage the
pivtokens on Triton compute nodes containing encrypted zpools.
The details are largely in [RFD 77](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/blob/master/rfd/0077/README.adoc) still.

The tl;dr is that when a CN boots, it will authenticate itself to KBMAPI,
and then request the pin to unlock its local PIV token.  Once unlocked, it
can supply the zpool encryption key to allow it to be imported.  It should
also at some point allow for recovery (i.e. replaced PIV token).


KBMAPI will be a fairly simple and minimal REST service.  API endpoints
provide the means for adding new PIV tokens, removing PIV tokens, recovering PIV tokens
(i.e. replacing a PIV token), as well as providing the PIN of a PIV token to an
authenticated entity.

When a PIV token is added, the KBMAPI service will need to generate a recovery
pivtoken (a random blob of data) that will be stored on the CN.  The recovery
token serves two purposes:  First, it is used by the CN as the recovery key
as described in <<prov-backups>>.  Second, it is also used by the CN as a
shared secret with KBMAPI for the purposes of replacing the PIV token information
of a CN with the data from a new PIV token.

### kbmapi-history

When PIV tokens are deleted or reinitialized, the old PIV token data should be kept in a
KBMAPI-maintained history.  This history maintains the PIV token data for an
amount of time defined by the `KBMAPI_HISTORY_DURATION` SAPI variable.  The
default shall be 15 days.  The purpose is to provide a time-limited backup
against accidental PIV token deletion.

#### Attestation

[yubi-attest](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/PIV_attestation.html)

Some PIV tokens have extensions that allow for attestation -- that is a method
to show that a given certificate was created on the device and not imported.
For Yubikeys, this is done by creating a special x509 certificate as detailed
[here](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/PIV_attestation.html).

If an operator wishes to require attestation, they must set the
`KBMAPI_REQUIRE_ATTESTATION` SAPI parameter to `true`.  In addition, the
`KBMAPI_ATTESTATION_CA` SAPI parameter must be set to the CA certificate
used for attestation.

Additionally, an operator may wish to limit the PIV tokens that are allowed to
be used with KBMAPI to a known set of PIV tokens.  To do so, an operator would
set the SAPI parameter `KBMAPI_REQUIRE_TOKEN_PRELOAD` to `true`.  A command
line tool (working name 'kbmapi') is then used by the operator to load the
range of serial numbers into KBMAPI.  This is only supported for PIV tokens that
support attestation (e.g. Yubikeys).  In other words, enabling
`KBMAPI_REQUIRE_TOKEN_PRELOAD` requires `KBMAPI_REQUIRE_ATTESTATION` to also
be enabled (but not necessarily vice versa).

It should be noted that since both the attestation and device serial numbers
are non-standard PIV extensions.  As such support for either feature will
require kbmd / piv-tool and potentially kbmapi to support a particular device's
implementation.  Similarly, enabling the feature requires the use of PIV tokens
that implement the corresponding feature (attestation or a static serial number).
The initial scope will only include support for Yubikey attestation and serial
numbers.

In both cases, enforcement of the policy occurs during the provisioning
process (i.e. at the time of a CreatePivtoken call).  Changes to either policy
do _not_ affect existing PIV tokens in KBMAPI.

#### PIV token object

The PIV token data needs to be persistently store (for hopefully obvious reasons).
A moray bucket will be used to store the PIV token data. The JSON config of the
bucket will be:

```
{
    "desc": "token data",
    "name": "pivtokens",
    "schema": {
        "index": {
            "guid": { "type": "string", "unique": true },
            "cn_uuid": { "type": "uuid", "unique": true }
        }
    }
}
```

The PIV token object itself will be represented using JSON similar to:

```
{
    "model": "Yubico Yubikey 4",
    "serial": 5213681,
    "cn_uuid": "15966912-8fad-41cd-bd82-abe6468354b5",
    "guid": "97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4",
    "pin": "123456",
    "recovery_tokens": [{
        "created": 123456789,
        "token": "jmzbhT2PXczgber9jyOSApRP337gkshM7EqK5gOhAcg="
    }, {
        "created": 2233445566,
        "token": "QmUgc3VyZSB0byBkcmluayB5b3VyIG92YWx0aW5l"
    }]
    "pubkeys": {
       "9e": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYA...",
       "9d": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYA...",
       "9a": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYA..."
    },
    "attestation": {
       "9e": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....",
       "9d": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....",
       "9a": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....."
    }
}
```


**Field**        | **Required** | **Description**
-----------------|--------------|-----------------
model            | No       | The model of the PIV token.
serial           | No       | The serial number of the PIV token (if available).
cn\_uuid         | Yes      | The UUID of the compute node that contains this PIV token.
guid             | Yes      | The GUID of the provisioned PIV token.
pin              | Yes      | The pin of the provisioned PIV token.
recovery\_tokens | Yes      | An array of recovery tokens.  Used to recover the encryption keys of a zpool protected by this PIV token.  Also used when replacing a PIV token.  When the recovery configuration is updated, a new recovery token is generated and added to the list.
pubkeys          | Yes      | A JSON object containing the _public_ keys of the PIV token.
pubkeys.9a       | Yes      | The public key used for authentication after the PIV token has been unlocked.
pubkeys.9d       | Yes      | The public key used for encryption after the PIV token has been unlocked.
pubkeys.9e       | Yes      | The public key used for authenticating the PIV token itself without a pin (e.g. used when requesting the pin of a PIV token).
attestation      | No       | The attestation certificates for the corresponding pubkeys.


Note that when provisioning a PIV token, if any of the optional fields are known,
(e.g. `attestation` or `serial`) they should be supplied during provisioning.

#### PIV token History

As a failsafe measure, when a PIV token is deleted, the entry from the PIV token
bucket is saved into a history bucket.  This bucket retains up to
`KBMAPI_HISTORY_DURATION` days of PIV token data (see [#kbmapi-history]).

The history bucket looks very similar to the PIV token bucket:

```
{
    "desc": "token history",
    "name": "pivtoken_history",
    "schema": {
        "index": {
            "guid": { "type": "string" },
            "cn_uuid": { "type": "uuid" },
            "active_range": { "type": "daterange" }
        }
    }
}
```

The major difference is that the index fields are not unique as well as the
`active_range` index.  An accidentally deleted PIV token that's restored might end
up with multiple history entries, and a CN which has had a PIV token replacement
will also have multiple history entries.

The moray entry in the history bucket also looks similar, but not quite the
same as the PIV token bucket:

```
{
    "active_range": "[2019-01-01 00:00:00, 2019-03-01 05:06:07]",
    "model": "Yubico Yubikey 4",
    "serial": 5213681,
    "cn_uuid": "15966912-8fad-41cd-bd82-abe6468354b5",
    "guid": "97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4",
    "pin": "123456",
    "recovery_tokens": [{
        "created": 123456789,
        "token": "jmzbhT2PXczgber9jyOSApRP337gkshM7EqK5gOhAcg="
    }, {
        "created": 2233445566,
        "token": "QmUgc3VyZSB0byBkcmluayB5b3VyIG92YWx0aW5l"
    }],
    "pubkeys": {
       "9e": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYA...",
       "9d": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYA...",
       "9a": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYA..."
    },
    "attestation": {
       "9e": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....",
       "9d": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....",
       "9a": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....."
    },
    "comment": ""
}
```

The major difference is the addition of the `active_range` property as well as
the `comment` property. The `active_range` property represents the (inclusive)
start and end dates that the provisioned PIV token was in use.

It's permitted that the same provisioned PIV token might have multiple entries in
the history table.  An example would be a PIV token accidentally deleted and
restored would have an entry for the deletion, and then a second entry when
the PIV token is retired (or reprovisioned).

The `comment` field is an optional field that contains free form text.  It is
intended to note the reason for the deletion.

To protect the PIV token data in Moray, we will rely on the headnode disk
encryption.

**QUESTION**: Even though the HN PIV token will not use the GetTokenPin
API call to obtain its pin, should we still go ahead and store the data for
the HN PIV token in KBMAPI?

#### Preloading PIV tokens

To support an operator preloading unprovisioned PIV tokens, we track ranges of
serial numbers that are allowed to be provisioned.  We use a separate
moray bucket for tracking these ranges of serial numbers:

```
{
    "desc": "pivtoken serials",
    "name": "pivtoken_serial",
    "schema": {
        "index": {
            "ca_dn": { "type": "string" },
            "serial_range": { "type": "numrange" }
        }
    }
}
```

The entries looks similar to:

```
{
    "serial_range": "[111111, 123456]",
    "allow": true,
    "ca_dn": "cn=my manf authority",
    "comment": "A useful comment here"
}
```


**Field**     | **Description**
--------------|-----------------
serial\_range | An range of serial numbers.  This range is inclusive.
allow         | Set to true if this range is allowed, or false is this range is blacklisted.
ca\_dn        | The distinguished name (DN) of the attestation CA for this PIV token.  Used to disambiguate any potential duplicate serial numbers between vendors.
comment       | An operator supplied free form comment.


The `kbmadm` command is used to manage this data.

#### Audit Trail

Given the critical nature of the PIV token data, we want to provide an audit
trail of activity.  While there is discussion of creating an AuditAPI at
some point in the future, it currently does not look like it would be available
to meet the current deadlines.  Once available, we should look at the effort
to migrate this functionality to AuditAPI.

In the meantime, we will provide the option of uploading the KBMAPI logs to
a Manta installation using hermes.

### Responses

All response objects are `application/json` encoded HTTP bodies.  In addition,
all responses will have the following headers:


**Header**  | **Description**
------------|-----------------
Date        | When the response wqas send (RFC 1123 format).
Api-Version | The exact version of the KBMAPI server that processed the request.
Request-Id  | A unique id for this request.


If the response contains content, the following additional headers will be
present:


**Header**     | **Description**
---------------|-----------------
Content-Length | How much content, in bytes.
Content-Type   | The format of the response (currently always `application/json`).
Content-MD5    | An MD5 checksum of the response.


#### HTTP Status Codes

KBMAPI will return one of the following codes on an error:

**Code** | **Description**    | **Details**
---------|--------------------|-------------
401      | Unauthorized       | Either no Authorization header was send, or the credentials used were invalid.
405      | Method Not Allowed | Method not supported for the given resource.
409      | Conflict           | A parameter was missing or invalid.
500      | Internal Error     | An unexpected error occurred.


If an error occurs, KBMAPI will return a standard JSON error response object
in the body of the response:

```
{
    "code": "CODE",
    "message": "human readable string"
}
```

Where `code` is one of:


**Code**           | **Description**
-------------------|------------------
BadRequest         | Bad HTTP was sent.
InternalError      | Something went wrong in KBMAPI.
InvalidArgument    | Bad arguments or a bad value for an argument.
InvalidCredentials | Authentication failed.
InvalidHeader      | A bad HTTP header was sent.
InvalidVersion     | A bad `Api-Version` string was sent.
MissingParameter   | A required parameter was missing.
ResourceNotFound   | The resource was not found.
UnknownError       | Something completely unexpected happened.


### KBMAPI Endpoints

These are the proposed endpoints to meet the above requirements.  They largely
document the behavior of the existing KBMAPI prototype (though in a few places
describe intended behavior not yet present in the prototype).

In each case, each request should include an `Accept-Version` header indicating
the version of the API being requested.  The initial value defined here shall
be '1.0'.

#### CreatePivtoken (POST /pivtokens)

Add a new initialized PIV token.  Included in the request should be an
`Authorization` header with a method of 'Signature' with the date header
signed using the PIV token's `9e` key.  The payload is a JSON object with the
following fields:


**Field**   | **Required** | **Description**
------------|--------------|-----------------
guid        | Yes          | The GUID of the provisioned PIV token.
cn\_uuid    | Yes          | The UUID if the CN that contains this PIV token.
pin         | Yes          | The pin for the PIV token generated during provisioning.
model       | No           | The model of the PIV token (if known).
serial      | No           | The serial number of the PIV token (if known).
pubkeys     | Yes          | The public keys of the PIV token generated during provisioning.
pubkeys.9a  | Yes          | The `9a` public key of the PIV token.
pubkeys.9d  | Yes          | The `9d` public key of the PIV token.
pubkeys.9e  | Yes          | The `9e` public key of the PIV token.
attestation | No           | The attestation certificates corresponding to the `9a`, `9d`, and `9e` public keys.


Note: for the optional fields, they should be supplied with the request when
known.  Unfortunately, there is no simple way to enforce this optionality on
the server side, so we must depend on the CN to supply the optional data
when appropriate.

If the signature check fails, a 401 Unauthorized error + NotAuthorized code
is returned.

If any of the required fields are missing, a 409 Conflict + InvalidArgument
error is returned.

If the `guid` or `cn_uuid` fields contain a value already in use in the
`tokens` bucket, a new entry is _not_ created.  Instead, the `9e` public key
from the request is compared to the `9e` key in the stored PIV token data.  If
the keys match, and the signature check succeeds, then the `recovery_token`
value of the existing entry is returned and a 200 response is returned. This
allows the CN to retry a request in the event the response was lost.

If the `9e` key in the request does not match the `9e` key for the existing
token in the `tokens` bucket, but either (or both) the `guid` or `cn_uuid`
fields match an existing entry, a 409 Conflict + NotAuthorized error
is returned.  In such an instance, an operator must manually verify if the
information in the PIV token bucket is out of date and manually delete it before
the PIV token provisioning can proceed.

If an operator has hardware with duplicate UUIDs, they must contact
their hardware vendor to resolve the situation prior to attempting to provision
the PIV token on the system with a duplicate UUID.  While we have seen such
instances in the past, they are now fairly rare.  Our past experience has
shown that attempting to work around this at the OS and Triton level is
complicated and prone to breaking.  Given what is at stake in terms of the
data on the system, we feel it is an unacceptable risk to try to work around
such a situation (instead of having the hardware vendor resolve it).

If the request does not generate any of the above errors, the request is
If the attestation section is supplied, the attestation certs _must_ agree
with the pubkeys supplied in the request.  If they do not agree, or if
`KBMAPI_ATTESTATION_REQUIRED` is true and no attestation certs are provided, a
409 Conflict + InvalidArgument error is returned.

If `KBMAPI_REQUIRE_TOKEN_PRELOAD` is `true`, the serial number of
the PIV token as well as the attestation certificates of the PIV token in question
must be present in the CreateToken request.  KBMAPI performs a search for
a range of allowed serial numbers in the `token_serial` bucket whose
attestation CA DN matches the attestation CA of the PIV token in the request.
If the serial number is not part of an allowed range, a
409 Conflict + InvalidArgument error is returned.

In addition, a `recovery_token` is generated by KBMAPI and stored as part of the
token object.  This should be a random string of bytes generated by a random
number generator suitable for cryptographic purposes.

Once the entry is updated or created in moray, a successful response is
returned (201) and the generated recovery token is included in the response.

Example request (with attestation)

```

       "9d": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....",
       "9a": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....."
    }
}
```

An example response might look like:

```

       "9d": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYA...",

        }
    ]
}
```

In order to make the request/response retry-able w/o generating and saving a new
`recovery_token` each time (to prevent a single recovery configuration update
from creating multiple `recovery_tokens` due to network/retry issues), any
requests made after the initial PIV token creation to the same `Location` (i.e.
`POST /pivtokens/:guid`) will result into the same PIV token object being
retrieved.

This can be used too in order to generate new recovery tokens when a request is
made at a given time after `recovery_token` creation. This time interval will
be configurable in SAPI through the variable `KBMAPI_RECOVERY_TOKEN_DURATION`.
By default, this value will be set to 1 day.

When the `POST` request is received for an existing PIV token, KBMAPI will
verify the antiquity of the newest member of `recovery_tokens` and in case it
exceeds the aforementioned `KBMAPI_RECOVERY_TOKEN_DURATION` value, it will
generate a new `recovery_token`.

On all of these cases, the status code will be `200 Ok` instead of the
`201 Created` used for the initial PIV token creation.

#### UpdatePivtoken (PUT /pivtokens/:guid)

Update the current fields of a PIV token.  Currently, the only field that can be
altered is the `cn_uuid` field (e.g. during a chassis swap).  If the new
`cn_uuid` field is already associated with an assigned PIV token, or if any of
the remaining fields differ, the update fails.

This request is authenticated by signing the Date header with the PIV token's 9e
key (same as CreateToken).  This however does not return the recovery token
in it's response.

Example request:

```

#### ReplacePivtoken (POST /pivtokens/:guid/replace)

When a PIV token is no longer available (lost, damaged, accidentally reinitialized,
etc.), a recovery must be performed.  This allows a new PIV token to replace the
unavailable PIV token.  When a replacement is required, an operator initiates the
recovery process on the CN.  This recovery process on the CN will decrypt the
current `recovery_token` value for the lost PIV token that was created during the
lost PIV token's CreatePivtoken request or a subsequent `CreatePivtoken` request.
For some TBD amount of time, earlier `recovery_token` values may also be allowed
to account for propagation delays when updating recovery configurations using
changefeed. KBMAPI may also optionally periodically purge members of
a PIV token's `recovery_tokens` array that are sufficiently old to no longer
be considered valid (even when accounting for propagation delays).

The CN submits a ReplacePivtoken request to replace the unavailable PIV token
with a new PIV token.  The `:guid` parameter is the guid of the unavailable PIV token.
The data included in the request is identical to that of a CreatePivtoken request.
The major difference is that instead of using a PIV token's 9e key to sign the date
field, the decrypted `recovery_token` value is used as the signing key.

Instead of HTTP Signature auth using the SSH key, HMAC signature using the
`recovery_token` as value will be used.

If the lost PIV token does not exists in KBMAPI we should reject the request with
a `404 Not Found` response.

If the request fails the authentication requests, a `401 Unauthorized` error
is returned.

If all the checks succeed, the information from the old PIV token (`:guid`) is
moved to a history entry for that PIV token. Any subsequent requests to
`/pivtokens/:guid` should either return a `404 Not found` reply. Note we do
not try to return a `301 Moved Permanently` response with a new PIV token
location because we could have a request to a PIV token which has already been
replaced by another, which in turn has been replaced by another one ...

The newly created PIV token will then be returned, together with the proper
`Location` header (`/pivtokens/:new_guid`). In case of network/retry issues,
additional attempts to retrieve the new PIV token information should be made
through `CreateToken` end-point for the new PIV token, and these requests should
be signed by the new PIV token 9e key, instead of using HMAC with the old PIV token
`recovery_token`.

#### ListPivtokens (GET /pivtokens)

Gets all provisioned PIV tokens.  The main requirement here is no
sensitive information of a PIV token is returned in the output.

Filtering by at least the `cn_uuid` as well as windowing functions should be
supported.

An example request:

#### GetToken (GET /pivtokens/:guid)

Gets the public info for a specific PIV token.  Only the public fields are
returned.

Example request:

```
GET /pivtokens/97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4

      "9a": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYA..."
   }
}
```

#### GetTokenPin (GET /pivtokens/:guid/pin)

Like GetToken, except it also includes the `pin`.  The `recovery_token` field
is *not* returned.  This request must be authenticated using the 9E key of the
token specified by `:guid` to be successful.  An `Authorization` header should
be included in the request, the value being the signature of the `Date` header
(very similar to how CloudAPI authenticates users);

This call is used by the CN during boot to enable it to unlock the other
keys on the PIV token.

An example request:

```
GET /pivtokens/97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4/pin
Host: kbmapi.mytriton.example.com
Date: Wed, 12 Feb 2019 02:11:32 GMT

    }
}
```

#### DeletePivtoken (DELETE /pivtokens/:guid)

Deletes information about a PIV token.  This would be called during the
decommission process of a CN.  The request is authenticated using the 9e
key of the PIV token.

Sample request:

```
DELETE /pivtokens/97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4 HTTP/1.1
Host: kbmapi.mytriton.example.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Signature <Base64(rsa(sha256($Date)))>
Api-Version: ~1
Content-Length: 0
```

Sample response:

```

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Accept, Accept-Version, Content-Length, Content-MD5, Content-Type, Date, Api-Version, Response-Time
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, DELETE
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Api-Version, Request-Id, Response-Time

Response-Time: 997
```

Note: alternatively, an operator can manually run kbmadm to delete an entry.

A destroyed PIV token is automatically added to `token_history`.

## Recovery Configuration(s)

We need to support the following features related to recovery config propagation:
1. A mechanism to ensure that we do not push recovery config X until recovery config X-1 has been sucessfully activated on all consumers.
2. An override mechanism that allows recovery config X to be pushed to consumers before earlier configs are known to be active.
3. A means to test the most recent recovery config before activation across the general population.
4. The ability to not activate a recovery configuration that has been staged.

Which was translated into:
1. KBMAPI must maintain an inventory of where each configuration is present and whether it is staged or active. This inventory needs to be robust in the face of down or rebooting nodes at any point during the staging and activation phases.
2. There should be a way to unstage a staged recovery configuration.
3. There should be a way to replace a staged recovery configuration.
4. There must be a way to unstage or replace a staged recovery configuration.
5. A mechanism for activating a staged configuration on a single compute node must exist.

Each configuration object contains a template, which is a base64 encoded string created by the cmd `pivy-box template create -i <name> ...`.

Here is how a template is created using `pivy-box` interactive mode:


```bash=
$ pivy-box tpl create -i backup
-- Editing template --
Select a configuration to edit:

Commands:
  [+] add new configuration
  [-] remove a configuration
  [w] write and exit

Select an attribute to change:
  [n] Name: (null)
  [c] Card Auth Key: (none set)

Commands:

This is the final result, after adding several keys to the recovery config:

```bash=

Here is how to get the values used by KBMAPI for a given template:

```javascript=
const crypto = require('crypto');
const fs = require('fs');
const input = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/.ebox/tpl/name');
// This is the template:
input.toString();

const hash = crypto.createHash('sha512');
hash.update(input.toString());
// And this is the hash value, used as identifier:
hash.digest('hex')
// => 'f85b894ed02cbb1c32ea0564ef55ee2438a86c5a4988ca257dd7c71953f349d9cf0472838099967d9ec4ca15603efad17f6ac6b3f434c9080f99d6f2041799d7'
// Instead of the hash (or together with), we can also generate a UUID
// using the following procedure:
var buf = hash.digest();
// variant:
buf[8] = buf[8] & 0x3f | 0xa0;
// version:
buf[6] = buf[6] & 0x0f | 0x50;
var hex = buf.toString('hex', 0, 16);
var uuid = [
    hex.substring(0, 8),
    hex.substring(8, 12),
    hex.substring(12, 16),
    hex.substring(16, 20),

].join('-');
```

### Recovery configurations lifecycle

Recovery configurations will go through a Finite State Machine during their expected lifecycles. The following are the definitions of all the possible states for recovery configurations:

* `new`: This state describes the raw parameters for the recovery configuration (mostly `template`) before the HTTP request to create the recovery configuration record in KBMAPI has been made.
* `created`: Once the recovery configuration has been created into KBMAPI through the HTTP request to `POST /recovery_configurations`. The recovery configuration now has a unique `uuid`, the attribute `created` has been added and, additionally, the process to stage this configuration through all the Compute Nodes using EDAR has been automatically started. (TBD: Shall this really be automatic or should we make it require a explicit HTTP request, just in case we want to just stage + activate on a single CN for testing before we proceed with every CN?)
* `staged`: The recovery configuration has been spread across all the CNs using EDAR (or at least to all the CNs using EDAR available at the moment we made the previous HTTP request). Confirmation has been received by KBMAPI that the _"staging"_ process has been finished.
* `active`: The request to activate the configuation across all the CNs where it has been previously staged has been sent to KBMAPI. The transtion from `staged` to `active` will take some time. We need to keep track of the transition until it finishes.
* `expired`: When a given recovery configuration has been replaced by some other and we no longer care about it being deployed across the different CNs using EDAR. This stage change for recovery configurations is a side effect of another configuration transitioning to `active`.

       |                     |                                         |

```

While there is an `expired` state, a given recovery configuration can only reach such state only when another one has been activated. There's no other value in keeping around an "expired" recovery configuration than allowing operators to reuse the same configuration several times w/o having to remove previous records due to the requirement for UUID uniqueness and the way it's generated through template hash. This configuration needs to be re-staged to all the CNs again, exactly the same way as if it were a new one.

Requirements:
- We need to be able to recover from CNAPI being down either at the beginning or in the middle of a transition.
- We need to be able to recover from KBMAPI going down in the middle of a transition.
- We need to be able to provide information regarding a transition not only to the client which initiated the process with an HTTP request, but to any other client instance, due to eventual console sessions abruptly finished or just for convenience.
- We need to be able to _"undo"_ transitions. It's to say, _"unstage"_ a work in progress `staging` process or _"deactivate"_ a work in progress `activation` process.
- We agree that it's OK to begin these _"undo"_ processes when the process we're trying to rollback has reached an acceptable level of progress. For example, if we want to deactivate a recovery configuration whose activation is in progress, taking batches of 10 CNs at time, and we have already processed 20 CNs and are in the middle of the process of the next 10, it'll be OK to wait until the activation of those 10 CNs has been completed before we stop the activation of any more CNs and begin the deactivation of the 30 CNs we are already done with.
- We may have more than one KBMAPI instance (HA-Ready) and each one of these instances may receive requests to report either progress on the transition or current list of CNs with one or other recovery configuration active.

With all these requirements, we need to have a **persistent cache** which can be accessed not only by the process currently orchestrating the transition between two possible recovery configuration state, but by any other process or instance trying to provide information regarding such process or the consequences of it. We need to have a process which will orchestrate the transition, updating this persistent cache with progress as needed. This process will also **lock** the transition so there isn't any other attempt to run it from more than one process at time.

This persistent cache will store, for each transition, the following information:
- The recovery configuration this transition belongs to.
- List of CNs/PIV Tokens to take part into the transition process (probably will be just the CNs using EDAR which are running at the moment the transition has been started)
- List of CNs where the transition has been completed and, in case of failure, as much information as possible regarding such failures.
- List of `taskid` for each CN where the transition is in progress. These will match with `taskid` for cn-agent into each CN which can be accessed through CNAPI using either `GET /tasks/:task_id` or `GET /tasks/:task_id/wait`.
- An indicator of wether or not the transition has been aborted.
- An indicator of whether or not the transition is running (possibly the unique identifier of the process orchestrating the transtion)

KBMAPI should provide:
- A process to orchestrate (run) the transtions (possibly backed up by a transient SMF service, which will come up handy in case of process exiting)
- An end-point to watch transitions progress.



We will have a moray bucket called `kbmapi_recovery_configs` with the following JSON config:

```json=
{
    "desc": "Recovery configuration templates",
    "name": "kbmapi_recovery_configs",
    "schema": {
        "index": {
            "uuid": { "type": "uuid", "unique": true },
            "hash": { "type": "string", "unique": true },
            "template": { "type": "string" },
            "state": { "type": "string" },
            "created": {"type": "date"},
            "staged": {"type": "date"},
            "activated": {"type": "date"},
            "expired": {"type": "date"}
        }
    }
}
```

Note the `state` field will include not only the final FSM states, but also the transitioning states so possible values are: `created`, `staging`, `unstaging`, `staged`, `activating`, `deactivating`, `active`, `expired` and `reactivating`. There's no transition associated with `expire` status, b/c that happens as a result of another configuration becoming the active one.

We may want to keep a list of configurations for historical purposes.

The persistent transition cache will be stored into another moray bucket with the following structure:

```json=
{
    "desc": "Recovery configuration transitions",
    "name": "kbmapi_recovery_config_transitions",
    "schema": {
        "index": {
            "recovery_config_uuid": { "type": "uuid" },
            "name": { "type": "string" },
            "targets" : {"type": ["uuid"] },
            "completed" : {"type": ["uuid"] },
            "wip": { "type": ["uuid"] },
            "taskids": { "type": ["string"] },
            "concurrency": { "type": "integer" },
            "locked_by": { "type": "uuid" },
            "aborted": {"type": "boolean"}
        }
    }

}
```

Where `targets` is the collection of CNs which need to be updated, `completed` is the list of those we're already done with, `wip` are the ones we're modifying right now and `taskids` are the CNAPI's provided `taskid` for each one of the CNs included in `wip` so we can check progress of such tasks using CNAPI. `locked_by` should be the UUID of the process which is currently orchestrating the transition.

We need to provide a way to check for stale processes leaving a transition locked. Having a way to periodically check for such processes sanity would be ideal. Looking for moray's `_mtime_` for the transtion object and compare against a default timeout would be a fine starting point.

## End-points

KBMAPI needs end-points to support the following command:

```
kbmctl recovery <add|show|list|activate|deactivate|stage|unstage|remove>
```

The following end-point and routes will be created:

 - HTTP Resource `/recovery_configs`:
     - `GET /recovery_configs` (ListRecoveryConfigs)
     - `POST /recovery_configs` (AddRecoveryConfig)
     - `GET /recovery_configs/:uuid` (ShowRecoveryConfig)
     - `PUT /recovery_configs/:uuid?action=stage` (StageRecoveryConfig)
     - `PUT /recovery_configs/:uuid?action=unstage` (UnstageRecoveryConfig)
     - `PUT /recovery_configs/:uuid?action=activate` (ActivateRecoveryConfig)
     - `PUT /recovery_configs/:uuid?action=deactivate` (DeactivateRecoveryConfig)
     - `GET /recovery_configs/:uuid?action=watch` (WatchRecoveryConfigTransition)
     - `DELETE /recovery_configs/:uuid` (RemoveRecoveryConfig)


### AddRecoveryConfig (POST /recovery_configs)

| Field      | Required | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| template   |  Yes     | Base64 encoded recovery configuration template.|
| concurrency|  No      | Number of ComputeNodes to update concurrently (default 10).|
| force      |  No      | Boolean, allow the addition of a new recovery config even if the latest one hasn't been staged (default false). |
| stage      |  No      | Boolean, automatically proceed with the staging of the recovery configuration across all nodes using EDAR w/o waiting for the HTTP request for `stage`.|


### WatchRecoveryConfigTransition (GET /recovery_configs/:uuid?action=watch&transition=\<name\>)

| Field      | Required | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| uuid       |  Yes     | The uuid of the recovery configuration to watch.|
| transition |  Yes     | The name of the transition to watch for the given config.|

Watch the transition from one recovery config state to the next one into the FSM.

This end-point will provide details regarding the transition progress using a JSON Stream of CNs which are or have already completed the transition, together with an eventual error message in case the transition failed for any of these CNs. When the transition has finished for all the CNs a final `END` event will be sent and the connection will be closed.

The format of these `Transition Progress Events` is still TBD.

In case a configuration has already finished a the given transition, the stream will be automatically closed right after the first response has been sent.

### ListRecoveryConfigs (GET /recovery_configs)

Get a list of recovery configurations. Note that both, this and the ShowRecoveryConfig end-points will grab all the existing PIV tokens in KBMAPI and provide a counter of how many PIV tokens are using each config. Additionally, the show recovery config will provide the uuids (hostnames too?) of the CNs using a given recovery configuration.

### ShowRecoveryConfig (GET /recovery_configs/:uuid)

| Field      | Required | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| uuid       |  Yes     | The uuid of the recovery configuration to retrieve.|

This returns a JSON object containing the selected recovery configuration. This is a JSON object like:
```json=
{
    "uuid": "f85b894e-d02c-5b1c-b2ea-0564ef55ee24",
    "template": "AAAewr22sdd...",
    "hash": "0123456789abcdef",

### RemoveRecoveryConfig (DELETE /recovery_configs/:uuid)

| Field      | Required | Description |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| uuid.      |  Yes     | The uuid of the recovery configuration to remove.|

Only a recovery configuration that isn't in use by any CN can be removed.

### Other notes

Note that we need at least one **recovery config** for everything to work properly. We'll need to figure out a way to provide such configuration either during initial headnode setup or during initial kbmapi install ...

At first pass we'll assume that there are no encrypted CNs at all and that if we want to encrypt some, we'll provide a mechanism to grab this config from the CN before we move ahead with the setup.

For now, we'll just ensure that KBMAPI will reply with a hint regarding the need of adding a recovery configuration before we can add new PIV tokens.

## Inventory: Recovery Configs associated with PIV tokens

There are different possible options to keep an up2date inventory of which recovery configuration is already staged and/or active into each CN with encrypted zpools (and therefore which recovery tokens associated witht those recovery configurations have been generated for the PIV tokens associated with these CNs).

The list of PIV Tokens stored by KBMAPI can be used as a cache of which configurations are present into each CN using EDAR. Each one of these PIV tokens have one or more recovery tokens associated with a given recovery configuration.

For example, for a CN with UUID `15966912-8fad-41cd-bd82-abe6468354b5` which has been created when a recovery configuration with hash `f85b894ed0...` was active, we'll initially have the following object with one associated recovery token:

```
{
    "model": "Yubico YubiKey 4",
    "serial": 5213681,
    "cn_uuid": "15966912-8fad-41cd-bd82-abe6468354b5",
    "guid": "97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4",
    "pin": "123456",
    "recovery_tokens": [{
        "created": 123456789,
        "activated": 123456789,
        "token": "jmzbhT2PXczgber9jyOSApRP337gkshM7EqK5gOhAcg...",
        "config": "recovery config template ..."
    }],
    "pubkeys": {
       "9e": "...",
       "9d": "...",
       "9a": "..."
    },
    "attestation": {
       "9e": "....",
       "9d": "....",
       "9a": "...."
    }
}
```

Note that on this initial case, the values for `recovery_tokens[0].created` and `recovery_tokens[0].activated` are the same, b/c this is the value we used for the initial CN setup.

If we have the need to generate another recovery token for this same PIV token, while the same configuration object is active, we'll have the following modification to the PIV token's `recovery_tokens` member:

```
{
    "cn_uuid": "15966912-8fad-41cd-bd82-abe6468354b5",
    "guid": "97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4",
    ...,
    "recovery_tokens": [{
        "created": 123456789,
        "activated": 123456789,
        "expired": 134567890,
        "token": "jmzbhT2PXczgber9jyOSApRP337gkshM7EqK5gOhAcg...",
        "config": "recovery config template ..."
    }, {
        "created": 134567890,
        "activated": 134567890,
        "token": "ecf1fc337276047347c0fdb167fb241b89226f58c95d...",
        "config": "another recovery config template ..."
    }],
    ...
}
```

The moment the new recovery_token has been activated, the previous one will be expired.

Then, when we add a new recovery configuration, a new recovery token will be added to each KBMAPI's PIV token and this information will be stored into the CN too. We'll call this latest recovery token to be _"staged"_.

```
{
    "cn_uuid": "15966912-8fad-41cd-bd82-abe6468354b5",
    "guid": "97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4",
    ...,
    "recovery_tokens": [{
        "created": 123456789,
        "activated": 123456789,
        "expired": 134567890,
        "token": "jmzbhT2PXczgber9jyOSApRP337gkshM7EqK5gOhAcg...",
        "config": "recovery config template ..."
    }, {
        "created": 134567890,
        "activated": 134567890,
        "token": "ecf1fc337276047347c0fdb167fb241b89226f58c95d...",
        "config": "another recovery config template ..."
    }, {
        "created": 145678901,
        "token": "aff4fbb14b3de5c7e9986...",
        "config": "yet another recovery config template ..."
    }],
    ...
}
```

Once we activate a recovery configuration already staged into all our active CNs using EDAR, each CN will update its local information accordingly and the KBMAPI's PIV token object will look as follows:

```
{
    "cn_uuid": "15966912-8fad-41cd-bd82-abe6468354b5",
    "guid": "97496DD1C8F053DE7450CD854D9C95B4",
    ...,
    "recovery_tokens": [{
        "created": 134567890,
        "activated": 134567890,
        "expired": 145678911,
        "token": "ecf1fc337276047347c0fdb167fb241b89226f58c95d...",
        "config": "another recovery config template ..."
    }, {
        "created": 145678901,
        "activated": 145678911,
        "token": "aff4fbb14b3de5c7e9986...",
        "config": "yet another recovery config template ..."
    }],
    ...
}
```

Note there is no need to keep more than the recovery tokens asociated with the currently active and staged configurations. Previous recovery tokens can be removed as part of the process of adding/activating a new one, given the information they may provide will be useless at this point and in the future.

#### Implementation details

In order to provide reasonable search options for client applications trying to figure out which recovery configuration is active or staged into each Compute Node, storing the recovery tokens as an array within the PIV Tokens moray bucket is not the better approach. Instead, we'll use a specific bucket where we'll save each token's properties and references to the PIV token that owns the recovery token, and the recovery configuration used for that token.


```json=
{
    "desc": "Recovery tokens",
    "name": "kbmapi_recovery_tokens",
    "schema": {
        "index": {
            "pivtoken_uuid": { "type": "uuid" },
            "configuration_uuid": { "type": "uuid" }
            "token": { "type": "string"},
            "created": {"type": "number"},
            "activated": {"type": "number"},
            "expired": {"type": "number"}
        }
    }
}
```

These recovery tokens will be then fetched from the PIV tokens model and loaded sorted by `created` value.

For new recovery config `staging` the CNs will be interested into the recovery config hash and template so those values should be provided together with the recovery token in order to avoid the need for another HTTP request.

For other actions like `activate`, `cancel`, `remove` ... the recovery config uuid would do just fine (or the hash, since it can also be used to refer the same resource).

TODO: Shall we use `date` type for all these dates instead of numbers? I dunno which was the original reason for using timestamps here.

### Inventory Update

During the add/activate new config phase, there are different possible ways to keep inventory _"up to date"_, meaning that PIV tokens stored into KBMAPI DB cache should reflect the reality of what it's already present into the CNs using EDAR.

Of these, the most simple one is to just wait for each addition/activation/removal (... whatever the KBMAPI task) to be completed. Using this approach there will be no need at all for changefeed publisher or subscribers.



```
+--------+  Add recovery cfg task  +-------+  run task  +----------+
| KBMAPI | ----------------------> | CNAPI | ---------> | cn-agent |--+
+--------+                         +-------+            +----------+  |
     ^   provide taskid to           |  ^   provide information       |
     |   wait for completion         |  |   about task progress       |
     +-------------------------------+  +-----------------------------+
```

Here, the "add recovery config" CN-Agent task consists of:

- Either we'll send the recovery_token's details when we call the `POST /servers/:server_uuid/recovery_config` end-point, or we'll let the cn_agent know that it has to perform an HTTP request to `POST /pivtokens/:guid` authenticated with the `9e` key of the Yubikey attached to the CN in order to retrieve such information. Let's assume at first that the simplest path will be used and, in order to save the extra HTTP request for each one of the CN agents, we'll provide the information on the original HTTP request to CNAPI. Params: `recovery token`, `hash`, `PIV token guid`, `action` (`add|activate|...`).
- The cn_agent will store then the values for the new recovery config and the new recovery token.
- The cn_agent will refresh local sysinfo to include the information about the new config hash.
- KBMAPI will wait for task completion.

Drawbacks/Advantages regarding using changefeed pub/sub:

- We need to block awaiting tasks completion while running the task from KBMAPI into multiple CNs. Given we want to run this task into a configurable number of CNs in parallel, we should provide some kind of `TASK_TIMEOUT` which will be fired, for example, when CNAPI _"thinks"_ that a server is running, but either the server isn't or cn-agent instance there is down. Failure into a single node shouldn't result into failure for all nodes, specially if it's a known failure like "node is down" or "cn-agent" is down. On these cases, we should still have the new recovery tokens created into KBMAPI or some other flag for later usage of a CN which, due to whatever reason, has been unable to complete the given recovery config task.
- When a node hasn't been able to complete the requested task due to whatever the reason (node down, cn-agent down, task execution failure) we need to provide a mechanism for the node to automatically try to get the latest configuration during the next boot of cn-agent. On these cases, we can add a task to cn-agent's init (similar to the current sysinfo or status report ones), where the agent will perform a check against KBMAPI end-point for its own CN and verify that the local information is consistent with whatever is expected into KBMAPI and, in case it's not, initiate a process similar to the one run during the aforementioned process.

```

+----------+   Tusing 9e key from Yubikey.                +--------+
| cn-agent | -------------------------------------------> | KBMAPI |<-+
+----------+ <------------------------------------------  +--------+  |
     |         PIV token including recovery tokens.                   |
     |                                                                ^
     v                                                                |
Compare local config and token                                        |

In case of differences, init a new |  update PIV token in KBMAPI      |
"recovery config" related task.    |------->------>------>------->----+
```

Note this task will be executed only when cn-agent detects that it's running at a server where EDAR is in use (encrypted zpool information, available from sysinfo).

- This approach has no issues with a possible flow or concurrent requests to either CNAPI or KBMAPI from the different cn-agents, since the tasks will run in batches of configurable number of CNs and we'll wait for completion, using a known size queue.
- Changefeed, either usig cn-agent or a custom kbm-agent means having publishers and subscribers keeping connections and processes up for something which shouldn't happen very frequently (recovery config modifications).


## Development status

- `token_serial` bucket needs to be created and end-point to access PIV tokens
  serial should be provided.
- SAPI configuration for attestation is not present and none of the associated
  functionalities implemented.

### Action items for recovery configurations implementation
- :white_check_mark: _"Recovery tokens should use their own moray bucket"_: Create recovery tokens bucket. Modify pivtokens model to store each recovery token into that bucket. Update pivtoken model to fetch the tokens from this bucket.
- _"Implement `POST|GET /pivtokens/:guid/recover`"_ Bring back to existence the `POST /pivtokens/:guid/recover CreateRecoveryToken` end-point. Ditto for `GET /pivtokens/:guid/recover ShowRecoveryToken`. The functionality of do not re-create a given recovery token for a given amount of time currently implemented for `CreatePivtoken` should be bundled with `CreateRecoveryToken` end-point.
- :white_check_mark: _"Write unit tests for pivtoken & recovery tokens models. Integration tests for PIV tokens end-points."_: make sure we have unit test for each model. Move current pivtokens test to integration.
- :white_check_mark: _"Every KBMAPI moray PUT should happen using eTags (HA-requirement)"_: Make sure any update attempt happens checking moray's eTags values to prevent overriding of outdated records.
- :white_check_mark: _"Add recovery configuration bucket/model/validations unit tests"_. Ensure we have at least one "active" recovery configuration.
- If we want to provide validation for the provided recovery configuration templates, we should either bundle pivy with the KBMAPI zones or Develop our own NodeJS module to read those.
- _"Implement recovery_configs end-points"_.
- :white_check_mark: _"A recovery configuration must be required when creating recovery tokens"_. Ensure PIV tokens related end-points _"croak"_ when there isn't at least one recovery configuration available. Update recovery tokens to include the uuid of a configuration. Set proper defaults for currently active configuration.
- Remove the functionality of automatically generate a new recovery_token each time an HTTP request has been made to `POST /pivtokens/:guid`, since we may want to provide additional details regarding which recovery configuration we want to use for the token we are creating. The `CreatePivtoken` end-point should create a recovery token with the currently "active" configuration.
- _"Add recovery config transitions buckets/model/validations and unit tests"_.
- _"Create service to run recovery configuration transitions"_: Create a recovery-config transition service/process which will run in parallel to the KBMAPI main process and will be responsible for orchestrate all the transitions between different recovery configuration statuses.

### Other action items
- Provide access to a given PIV Token using CN's UUID in order to make possible for cn-agent task run on CN boot to perform a verify request against KBMAPI. Consider using `GET /pivtokens?uuids=[]` list of CN's UUIDs in a similar way than CNAPI does for these searches.
- Implement `PUT /tokens/:guid` to allow updates of some PIV Token CN UUID.
